            <h2>Brain Imaging and Its Importance</h2>
            <p>
                Brain imaging, such as MRI and CT scans, plays a crucial role in diagnosing and understanding various neurological conditions. These imaging techniques provide detailed insights into the brain's structure and function, helping doctors detect abnormalities like tumors, strokes, and brain injuries. Early diagnosis through medical imaging is essential for effective treatment and improving patient outcomes.

            <p>
                Medical imaging is not only important for the detection of diseases but also for planning and monitoring treatment strategies. For instance, in brain cancer patients, imaging can help doctors track the progress of the tumor, assess the effectiveness of treatments like chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and make decisions for future interventions. Early and precise detection significantly improves the chances of successful treatment.
